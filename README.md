Summary
-------
I graduated from Cheng-Kung Unversity in Civil Engineering. Despite lack of experinece in computer science , I have dreaming being one of member in this industry. About my personality, I am passsionate about seeking the fundemental of things. Thinking and solving a problem all day comes naturally to me. Besides that, I am not afraid facing challenge and learning from others.

My goal is to become a back-end or data engineer within 4 months training. After that, I will work and strengthen my coding skills in those enterprise. During this period, I will absorb the concept of alogothiroms and study other's code on GitHub as much as I can.

Education
-------
* Bachelor Degree at [Cheng Kung University Civil Engineering ](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/)
* Master Degree at [Cheng Kung University Geotechnical Group](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/)


Experience
----------

### **Introduction to Computer at Bachelor Degree **

*Sep 2016 - Jan 2017* (4 months)

The course let us use C++ in IDE Visuo Studio Code to write some code. It aims to introduce basic concept of compoter science , such as the concept of string, the type of variable and overflow. I really liked the course and spent lots of time on this. It leads me to the entrance of the computer science. 

### **Intership** at [Taiwan High Speed Raail](https://en.thsrc.com.tw/corp/governance)

*Jun 2019 - Jul 2019* (2 months)

As an intern in Railway Group, we are assigned to present a small project. The project is to let field engineers know the stock statsu in each base. Due to time limit, we only propose the framework and collect suggestion. Although it's quite childhood and ugly, I still enjoy the journey of developing this. 

### **Matlab at Master Degree**

*Sep 2020 -  Jun 2022* 

De to the course, I use MATLAB to transform the vibration signals into Frequency field. Although there are many useful toolboxes in MATLAB, it's still a hard challenge since we have to figure out the mathimetical formula before writing the code (namely frouier transform). After that , I use MATLAB to do some research , manipulate the EXCEL and plot the results. During this period, I have learned about searching technical problems on stack-ovrflow and MATLAB Community.

### **VB code at work**

*Sep 2022 -  Now* 

Since we have to meet the requirement form client ,I wrote some VBA code to release the burden for the team. The VBA code is to collect all the work content from each person. First , it detect the files in the folder by regular expression. Once it meets the target, it will open the file and gather the work content for each person. With this tool , our project team don't have to use EXCEL to do some repetitive work. 

After that , I write a code for recording the information timesheet automatically. It saves us lots of time to input data from person to person. However, I still think that there's better way to solve this problem - Web Developement.
